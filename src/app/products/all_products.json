                "A coffee bean is the seed of the coffee plant. The fruits, coffee cherries or coffee berries, most commonly contain two beans with their flat sides together. Coffee beans consist mostly of endosperm that contains 0.8 – 2.5 % caffeine, which is one of the main reasons the plants are cultivated. As coffee is one of the world’s most widely consumed beverages, coffee beans are a major cash crop, and an important export product for some countries."
